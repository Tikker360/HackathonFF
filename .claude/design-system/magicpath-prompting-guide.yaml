# MagicPath Conversational Prompting Guide
# Optimized for canvas-based rapid prototyping with natural language

version: "1.0"
meta:
  purpose: "Enable AI to generate MagicPath-optimized prompts for Apple-level UI prototypes"
  style: "Conversational, narrative, interaction-focused"
  platform: "https://www.magicpath.ai/"

core_principles:
  tone:
    - "Be direct and conversational - use 'Let's create...' or 'Create a...'"
    - "Think like describing to a colleague, not writing documentation"
    - "Be succinct to reduce credit cost, vague to be exploratory"
    - "Focus on user interactions and flows, not implementation details"

  structure:
    - "Start with the overall concept and purpose"
    - "Describe user flow chronologically"
    - "Include visual design references"
    - "Specify technical integrations (APIs, libraries)"
    - "End with sizing or layout considerations if relevant"

  enhancement:
    - "Always prefer uploading reference images or sketches"
    - "Screenshots of interactions/sites/dashboards work extremely well"
    - "Pen and paper sketches are the ultimate prototyping tool"
    - "Mention existing components with @ symbol for composition"

starter_patterns:
  opening_phrases:
    exploratory:
      - "Let's create..."
      - "Can you create..."
      - "Let's make..."
      - "Build a..."

    specific:
      - "Create a component..."
      - "Create an element..."
      - "Make a mobile..."
      - "Build a modern..."

  flow_description:
    interaction_sequence:
      - "When I [action], [result] should happen"
      - "Tapping [element] will [outcome]"

      - "As the user [action], it should [response]"

    state_changes:
      - "When closed, it appears as [state A]. When clicked, it opens up into [state B]"
      - "At all other times, [default state]. When [trigger], [active state]"
      - "The [element] should start [initial state], and [transition description]"

    visual_transitions:
      - "The animation should be smooth and a little bouncy"
      - "Animate in from the bottom with a faded blur effect"
      - "The transition from [state A] to [state B] should be smooth and [quality]"

component_composition:
  using_mentions:
    syntax: "@Component Name"
    examples:
      - "Match our visual style using @Status Bar at the top"
      - "When I press purchase, animate using @Enable Notification Card"
      - "Include @Dial Pad Dark below with @Bottom navigation at the bottom"

    important:
      - "Use @ to reference components already on canvas"
      - "This enables visual consistency and composition"
      - "The model understands spatial relationships (top, below, at the bottom)"

creating_vs_composing:
  single_elements:
    phrase_required: "Must use 'create a component' or 'create an element'"
    examples:
      - "Create a component that lists web components with visual previews"
      - "Create an element for a signature button"
    sizing:
      - "It should be about 338px by 418px"
      - "The main font size for this is 12px"

  full_pages:
    default: "Omit 'component' phrase for full page designs"
    examples:
      - "Create a freelance project quote creator mobile app"
      - "Let's create a story creation app called Journey"

visual_design_language:
  minimalism:
    - "Clean visual hierarchy with clear CTAs"

  motion_quality:
    - "The animation transition should be smooth and a little bouncy"
    - "Slight offset, 200ms easing out, and a subtle 1px blur"

complete_examples:
  simple_component:
    prompt: |
      Create a signature button on a canvas. When closed, it appears as a pencil
      icon in a round button. When clicked, it opens up into a small drawable area
      with a note in the top left saying draw signature, and a hold to confirm
      button in the bottom right.

      The user can draw their signature with a mouse, and once they finish, the
      signature animates on a loop filling up from the direction they started in,
      similar to a stroke animation with SVG. The ghost of the signature appears,
      with a darker stroke animating to fill it as if drawing on a loop.

  complex_interaction:
    prompt: |
      Let's make a demo of something called a facedock. The concept is that you
      can draw a frame inside of an infinite canvas app that acts as a "dock" for
      a user's webcam feed. It's a resizable object that gets filled with the
      user's webcam feed when they hover over it.

      At all other times, their webcam feed is locked into a circle that follows
      their cursor in the app to show other people their presence.

      When the feed is inside of the dock object, the user can click to lock it
      in place so that when their cursor leaves the dock it stays inside and no
      longer follows. When they click on the locked dock again, the feed follows
      the cursor again.

      The user can draw multiple facedock objects using a tool in the toolbar at
      the bottom. The toolbar also contains a way to turn off their webcam feed.
      The animation transition should be smooth and a little bouncy.

  technical_app:
    prompt: |
      Create a minimal, modern, dark-mode clock countdown interface that counts
      down to two days in the future. The clock should have large sans-serif type
      that shows hours : minutes : seconds counting in realtime synced to the
      current time using moment.js. The numbers should animate in from the bottom
      of the previous numbers with a faded blur effect.

  with_composition:
    prompt: |
      Let's add controls to the right of each item to be able to drag and reorder
      them, and change quantity with a plus and minus icon on either side of an
      input showing a count. If I set quantity to 0 the items should be removed.
      Match our visual style.

      When I press purchase, we should animate the card to show a purchase
      complete modal using @Enable Notification Card

    note: "References existing component with @ for composition"

best_practices:
  do:
    - "Break down interactions into chronological steps"
    - "Use conversational, natural language"
    - "Reference visual examples when possible"
    - "Specify library integrations explicitly (moment.js, tone.js, etc.)"
    - "Include sizing for components (338px by 418px, font 12px)"
    - "Describe animation quality (smooth, bouncy, blur)"
    - "Use 'create a component' for single elements"
    - "Create slots for user API keys, never hardcode"

  dont:
    - "Don't use technical implementation details (useState, CSS classes)"
    - "Don't write API keys or tokens in prompts"
    - "Don't be overly prescriptive about code structure"
    - "Don't skip describing the user experience flow"
    - "Don't forget to specify mobile vs desktop optimization"

iterative_refinement:
  follow_up_patterns:
    visual_polish:
      - "Can you add a transparent gradient reflection faux-shine effect?"
      - "The gradient shine should be fairly dramatic with a pure white streak"
      - "Let's create a statically animated gradient tied to mouse position"

    interaction_tuning:
      - "The animation's direction should correspond to the user's mouse position"
      - "As the user moves their mouse, it should change the animation progress"
      - "Make the tilt proportional to distance from center"

    layout_adjustments:
      - "Let's optimize for mobile with a touch-friendly interface"
      - "Use single column layout for mobile"
      - "Progressive onboarding through guided steps"

apple_quality_indicators:
  motion:
    - "Smooth and a little bouncy" (spring physics feel)
    - "200ms easing out" (snappy responsiveness)
    - "Subtle 1px blur" (motion blur for smoothness)
    - "Interruptible animations" (responsive to user input)

  visual_hierarchy:
    - "Clean visual hierarchy with clear CTAs"
    - "Avoid gradients" (unless strategically used for depth)
    - "Large sans-serif type" (readability focus)
    - "Minimal, modern, dark-mode" (refined aesthetic)

  interaction_quality:
    - "Touch-friendly interface" (44px+ hit targets)
    - "Progressive onboarding" (gradual complexity reveal)
    - "Real-time calculation/feedback" (immediate response)
    - "Context preservation during transitions" (spatial understanding)

css_light_dark_pattern:
  description: "Dynamic color theming with CSS color-scheme"
  implementation: |
    When describing color systems, mention:
    "The interface should support both light and dark modes. Use CSS color-scheme
    to automatically adapt system colors, with custom theme overrides for brand colors."

  example_language:
    - "Support light and dark modes with automatic color adaptation"
    - "Theme-aware colors that respect system preferences"
    - "Use light-dark() CSS function for dynamic color values"
